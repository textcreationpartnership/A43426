         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Serve no other ends in piecing together theſe few <hi>Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> than to give an honeſt Inſtance of my Duty and Thankfulneſs: for wherever any Obligation lies upon a man, common honeſty leads him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to pay the Debt. Now, ſeeing it is impoſſible for me, according to my ſmall Talent, to diſcharge the Total Sum, I am reſolved, as much as in me lies, to make this <hi>publick Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, viz.</hi> to be just and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. For the Apostle makes Ingratitude

the Compendium of all Impiety,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2.</note> in theſe two words, <hi>unthankful, unholy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you ſee the plain reaſon why I bestow my thoughts upon the Memory of this <hi>Great man:</hi> to whom I, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others owe all we can expreſs, (not that I reflect upon the ſilence of any man, who, for ought I know, may in his private Cloſet give more ſubstantial <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonials</hi> of his Thankfulneſs, than I can, by this faint endeavour, in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick way) beſides, though in general, all men, who receive favours, are bound to be thankful; yet I am apt to think, <hi>every ſingle man has as much right to chooſe the way of expreſſing his Thanks, as he has a propriety to his Complexion and Fortunes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In digging up the Foundations of Ancient and Religious Houſes, 'tis uſual
<pb facs="tcp:49566:7"/>
to find <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rns and old Reliques of Men and Times; ſometimes the uncorrupted Carkaſs of a great and <hi>celebrated Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:</hi> Theſe and the like Curioſities are thought worthy to be expoſed to common view; if ſo, this I hope may in part excuſe my preſent Attempt. For occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally ſearching in the Duſt and <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> of the preſent <hi>Charter-houſe;</hi> now and then I could not but meet with a Leg or an Arm, ſome ſtrokes of the <hi>Ancient Model,</hi> ſome few fragments of the old Foundation: But at laſt I met with the <hi>Original Grants and Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> for this <hi>Carthuſian Monaſtery,</hi> in the moſt elaborate Works of that Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Antiquary of our Age, Mr. <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale.</hi>

will perform, with the unreſiſted eloquence of its own nature, without the formidable Retinue of <hi>Guards and Tumult:</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo varied the Worſhip of God, <hi>for, Examples are the Springs from whence human a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions derive their motion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The power of the Laws may purſue and ſeize upon the body; but Example ſurpriſes and attacks the ſoul; it invades and charms the mind with the ſecret Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick of love and imitation: It <hi>repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents vertue</hi> to the world, not in faint and languiſhing colours, but moving, full of life and vigour: It <hi>propounds Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> not as <hi>imperious and tyrannical</hi> in its precepts, but eloquent and attractive in its Operations. <hi>Thus the great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of Obedience is maſter'd, and made eaſie by our deſire of imitation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I thought therefore it would not be

            <p>Yet theſe great men meet with ſome ſtrokes of misfortune, from the ruder Ages wherein they live; for as the <hi>higheſt Mountains</hi> are moſt ſubject to the ſtorms of Thunder, and the batteries of Hail: ſo theſe who are placed on high, are the uſual marks at which the Inſtruments of Envy and Malice are level<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The helps I found in the compoſure of <hi>Sutton</hi>'s <hi>life,</hi> were many of them ſcatter'd here and there, laid hold on rather by chance than direction; For the World has not been ſo kind to this <hi>Great man,</hi> as to repreſent him to the open view, with thoſe graceful lines and fair advantages his Actions really have deſerved.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Richard Baker,</hi> Dr <hi>Heylin,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi> ſay little of him, and that little very full of miſtakes, for they call him <hi>Richard Sutton,</hi> and affirm he lived a Batchelor, and ſo by his ſingle life had an opportunity to lay up a heap of mony; whereas his <hi>dear wife</hi> is, with much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and respect, mentioned in his <hi>Will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others give him bad words, ſay he was born of obſcure and mean Parents, and
<pb facs="tcp:49566:11"/>
married as inconſiderable a wife, and dy'd without an Heir: but then to give ſome reaſon for his Wealth (having no time nor deſire to enquire into the means of his growing rich) to cut ſhort the buſineſs, they reſolve all into a <hi>Romantick Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture;</hi> they ſay it was all got at a lump by an accidental ſhipwrack, <hi>which the kind waves drove to ſhore, and laid at his feet, whilſt the fortunate</hi> Sutton <hi>was walking penſively upon the barren Sands.</hi> They report, in the Hulk Coals were found, and under them an ineſtimable Treaſure, a great heap of <hi>Fayery wealth.</hi> This, I fancy, may go for the <hi>Fable,</hi> and his farming the Coal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines (as may be ſeen hereafter) for the <hi>Moral.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Errors of the former, and dreams of the latter, will be ſufficiently diſcovered by the following <hi>Hiſtory of his Life;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:49566:12"/>
ſome Remarks whereof I had from credita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and worthy men, bred in this Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion long ago: Others by a Commemoration Sermon of Mr. <hi>Burrel</hi>'s, preached in a fit time to declare the truth; for ſeveral of the firſt list of Governours were then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and one of the Founders Executors, <hi>viz.</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Sutton.</hi> This I have by me in print.</p>
            <p>I had likewiſe aſſiſtance from the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords</hi> of the Houſe, and laſtly from an Anonymous and Imperfect MS. left, not long ſince, in the Bookſellers hands, which did me very good ſervice.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now only offer a word or two in the behalf of good Works, and then proceed to the Hiſtorical part.</p>
            <p>Nothing is more pleaſing to him, who is the <hi>Giver of good Gifts unto men,</hi> than to ſee his own Bleſſings rightly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and bestowed upon Objects of pitty
<pb facs="tcp:49566:12"/>
and compaſſion; Moreover, by this we ſhew our thankfulneſs to God; <hi>for, the trueſt Notion of Gratitude, is never to give an occaſion that our Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour ſhould repent that he beſtow'd his Bounty upon us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>By Charity alſo</hi> we do good to men, we oblige and endear our Neighbour; we imitate the good Angels, nay our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our himſelf, who went about all</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea <hi>doing good;</hi> though his Eſtate and Kingdom was not in this World, yet among his few Diſciples, he choſe one an <hi>Almoner</hi> to ſcatter his Benevolence, and to diſtribute his ſmall Treaſure: <hi>Love and Charity are as neceſſary to the well-being of States and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the Body Politick, as union of parts is in the material and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Furthermore,</hi> by acts of mercy and
<pb facs="tcp:49566:13"/>
pitty, we are kind to our own ſelves; for no good man can, without grief, behold the gaping wounds of a poor <hi>Lazarus,</hi> this makes his bowels yearn, and his own Soul bear a part in ſorrow, ſo that by healing his ſores, and binding up his wounds, by relieving his pain, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing his ſpirits, he eaſes his own mind, and does an office of kindneſs to himſelf: and this ſeems to be the proper ſenſe of the Prophet, <hi>When thou ſeeſt the naked, cover him; that thou hide not thy ſelf from thine own fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, nothing more ſecures our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Heaven, nor gives a fairer Title to the <hi>bleſſed Manſions</hi> above; for the Scripture informs us, that at the great and terrible day of Judgment inquiry will be made, <hi>Whether we have fed the hungry, and clothed the naked? vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited the ſick, and redeemed the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner?</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:49566:13"/>
for Charity is ſo requiſite, in order to our well being in the other world, that <hi>Abraham</hi> would hardly think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf now in heaven, had he not a <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> in his boſom.</p>
            <p>It may be theſe Arguments were the cauſe of ſo much good, that is found of this nature in the world; for I believe we read of few or no <hi>Hoſpitals</hi> before the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Chriſtian Religion. Nor is this a private fancy of my own, but partly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from the ſilence of former Ages in reference to theſe works of Charity; and partly from ſeveral <hi>barbarous Inſtances</hi> of State-policy, which were enjoyned to prevent the neceſſity of ſuch Structures, and Proviſions for needy people.</p>
            <p>Theſe were cuſtomary in many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and gravely preſcribed by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf, in theſe words;<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>7.</hi> Pol. cap. <hi>16.</hi>

            <p>Several, who were ſick and weakly, having no means of ſubſiſtence, and hopes of human pitty, did make Sale of their lives, that upon their recovery, both they and their Poſterity ſhould be ſlaves to him

that was at the expence of the Relief. If any perſon happened to be lame or blind, he thought it in vain to endeavour to move the compaſſion of barbarous and ſelf-ended men; therefore their cuſtom was to lay vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hands upon themſelves, to put a period to their miſerable lives and wretched for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. This was the lamentable effect of <hi>Pagan uncharitableneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when once <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great appear'd, enabled with the Riches and Authority of Empire, he bravely redreſſed all theſe horrid and inhuman practiſes,<note place="margin">Euſeb. Hiſt. Lib. <hi>10.</hi>
               </note> and erected many ſtructures for to entertain and refreſh the ſons and daughters of pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and compaſſion. This excellent example <hi>Julian the Apoſtate</hi> could not but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud and imitate, as may be ſeen by his Letters ſent to the <hi>Proconſuls and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Aſia,</hi> perſwading them to follow the examples of Chriſtians in this matter;
<pb facs="tcp:49566:15"/>
and though he reigned alone ſcarce two years, yet he left many monuments of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity behind him.</p>
            <p>After theſe Reigns, the good and pious <hi>Emperours</hi> were strangely forward in this way of Charity, and their <hi>Benefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> became almost incredible. Nay, the very <hi>Turks</hi> now are famous for it; and it ſeems not only a good act of kindneſs and piety among them, but alſo a wiſe forecaſt, and prudent conſideration. For no Turk is ſolicitous to provide for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture condition of his family, lest he ſhould provoke the jealouſie of the <hi>Grand Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> and be cruſhed in a moment; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they uſually leave their Children to cut out their own Fortunes, who, if they ſhould prove maimed or ſickly, are in theſe places provided for.</p>
            <p>They have one <hi>Hoſpital</hi> at the entrance of <hi>Mare Majore,</hi> coming from <hi>Boſpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:49566:15"/>
which was founded by <hi>Solyman</hi>'s Daughter, the Wife of <hi>Ruſtan Baſſa,</hi> and by her endowed with 8000 Ducats <hi>per An.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is another built by a certain <hi>Baſſa</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Phermena,</hi> not far from <hi>Delos,</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Mahomet</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. who conquered <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople;</hi> it is endowed with 12000 Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats <hi>per Ann.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A third is at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> begun by <hi>Mahomet</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. and finiſhed by <hi>Bajazet</hi> his ſon; it enjoyes 60000 Ducats <hi>per An.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe, with many others in the <hi>Turkiſh Dominions,</hi> are erected to entertain ſick and lame people, men who are unfit for labour, and whoſe conditions require Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. The <hi>Governours</hi> of their Hoſpitals uſually walk out, and deſire wearied Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, and that ſort of people which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly line the Highways, to repair hither, and accept of the kindneſs and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb facs="tcp:49566:16"/>
of the <hi>charitable Houſe.</hi> Many of them are, by their Eſtabliſhments, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive perſons of any Religion, which is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a generous inſtance of kindneſs and civility. Near theſe Foundations com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly a <hi>Moſque</hi> or Temple is erected; as now upon <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> and elſewhere; for thoſe that are relieved are required to pray there for the Soul of the <hi>Founder:</hi> the place where they intend to raiſe ſuch a work of Charity, is frequently made choice of in ſome ſolitary and retired place, to avoid vain glory. Their Charity like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe extends to the Inhabitants of the Aery and Watry Elements, for they hire men to feed fiſhes in common Rivers, and with expence purchaſe the Releaſe of encaged Birds.</p>
            <p>We read likewiſe of five goodly Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals in <hi>Fez;</hi> and of a <hi>Perſian King,</hi> who cauſed a <hi>Moſque</hi> to be built in <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:49566:16"/>
at the foot of that Mountain whereon <hi>Noah</hi>'s <hi>Ark</hi> rested: this is a Receptacle for men of all ſorts of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions and Complexions, <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Turks, Moors</hi> and <hi>Arabs:</hi> here all are entertained three days and three nights, with much kindneſs and freedom; and for its maintenance it is endowed with 40000 Ducats <hi>per Ann.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we may obſerve the riſe and spreading of theſe <hi>Inſtances of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction;</hi> how much it redounds to the honour of <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> that as it at first out of its excellent Principles began this work, ſo now it does continue it, and provokes the emulation of all <hi>Countries.</hi> For the honour of our own Nation, I ſhall conclude with the words of Dr. <hi>Willet</hi> in that part of his <hi>Synop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:49566:17"/>I truſt I have made it good, that more Charitable Works have been done in theſe 60 years of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, than in the like time in Popery; I think they cannot ſhew in any Age almoſt a Million beſtowed in Works of Charity; more than forty Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, above twenty Free ſchools and more than ten Colledges and Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>

a very ſtrange and wondrous accident: the Relation whereof I find much after this manner. <hi>Bruno</hi> a German, born at <hi>Cologne,</hi> of an ancient and worthy Family, by his ſtudious life and ſucceſsful endeavours, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſo great a reputation among learned Men, that he was at length prevailed with to viſit <hi>France,</hi> where he was honourably choſen Philoſophy Profeſſour of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of <hi>Paris:</hi> Not long after chancing to be preſent at the Funeral Solemnities of one of his dear Friends, a Man, as far as mortal eye could diſcern, of a fair and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted reputation: On a ſuddain, whilſt they were celebrating the Office for the Dead, and were come to that part of it, <hi>Reſponde mihi:</hi> the Corps began to move, and raiſe it ſelf upon the Bier, and was heard at ſeveral diſtances of time to utter theſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable words; <q>I am arraigned at the Bar of God's Juſtice: my final Sentence is already paſt: And I am condemned to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Torments.</q>

                     <p>'Tis eaſie to imagine what a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation this unexpected Revelation wrought in the minds of the People; but eſpecially it troubled his familiar and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Friend <hi>Bruno,</hi> who could not but be ſurpriz'd with grief and melancholy: thinks

he, if ſo vertuous and religious a man can periſh, and be for ever undone, what muſt become of me? If my loving and faithful Companion, who was eminent for Juſtice and Piety, if ſo fair a complexion'd Soul ſcarcely can be ſaved, where ſhall I, who am unrighteous, appear? If the unwelcom ſight of one damned Perſon ſo much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbs all men who behold him; if one ſingle inſtance of God's vindictive Juſtice create ſo much confuſion in our Spirits, then how painful will be the torments of the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Hell, where crowds and throngs, where an innumerable company of deſpairing Souls lye panting under the heavy load of ſin, and do in vain eccho forth one anothers fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Lamentation? If the condemnation of another ſo much concerns and ruffles my diſcompoſed mind, then what a ſtorm muſt I expect, when my tryal does approach, and puniſhment lyeth at my own door?</p>
                     <p>After this, or the like conflict with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Bruno</hi> reſolves to alter the frame and courſe of his life, and to that end prevails with ſix more Spectators to joyn with him: by name, <hi>Laudvinus,</hi> two <hi>Stephens, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go</hi> (who was alſo their Chaplain) and two Laicks, <hi>Andrew</hi> and <hi>Garinus.</hi> Theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven religiouſly determined to retire from the World; to abſent themſelves from the

noiſe and hurry of buſineſs and tumult, and to ſeek ſome convenient place where they might ſpend the remainder of their days, in Exerciſes of Piety and Devotion, in Corporal Auſterities, and in a ſevere and mortified courſe of Life.

                        <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the Rules and Constitution of the Order.</head>
                     <p>AS ſoon as ever theſe ſeven Pilgrims were entred into the City, <hi>Hugh</hi> the Biſhop dreams that he ſaw ſeven Stars fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len at his feet; which afterwards climbed over divers Mountains, and then ſtood ſtill in a certain horrid and obſcure place. At this time it was that they happily arrived at his Palace, and obtaining leave to confer with him, they diſcover the intentions of their journey, and humbly deſire the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of ſo great and good a man, for the proſecution of their deſigns.</p>
                     <p>About the diſtance of ten miles from the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49566:29"/>
City of <hi>Grenoble,</hi> ariſes a certain high Mountain in a wild manner encompaſs't with Woods and Thickets; which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Carthuſe,</hi> (from whence this Order takes its name, as another does from Mount <hi>Carmel</hi>) The aſcent to this Hill is ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, that it is reckon'd an Emblem of the way to Heaven; ſo high, ſo ſteep it is, and craggy: Nature has beſtowed upon this Monaſtery a double Entrance, the one is call'd the <hi>Carthuſian</hi> Bridge, where two hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Banks raiſe themſelves to an incredible height, and joyn at the top. The other is full of danger and wonders, being a weary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and uneaſie paſſage four miles long between two rocky and mountainous ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings. Hither came theſe ſeven Converts with much pains and difficulty under the happy conduct of the aforeſaid Biſhop; and here was to be the Plantation of <hi>Bruno</hi>'s Piety and Holineſs: The Biſhop gravely pronounces <hi>En Veſter hic locus.</hi> And then they kneel down, and offer up the Sacrifice of Praiſe and Thankſgiving to Almighty God.</p>
                     <p>The Reaſons why a Mountain was made choice of, rather than a Valley, to be the Habitation of this Order, are many: for ſay they, we are now nearer Heaven: here the Patriarchs of old did inhabit: when
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49566:29"/>
                        <hi>Abram</hi> went to Sacrifice, he aſcended the Mountain: and thus did <hi>Lot</hi> when he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcap't the anger of the Lord: <hi>Moſes</hi> went up to the Mountain to receive the Law: here lived <hi>Elias,</hi> and the Sons of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</p>
                     <p>This Mountain they compare to Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> becauſe here <hi>Bruno</hi> gave them their Rules and Conſtitution: ſometimes to Mount <hi>Oreb,</hi> for the renown of their Zeal and Charity: to <hi>Seir,</hi> becauſe they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, and have ſpread over moſt parts of Chriſtendom: to <hi>Moriah (mons viſionis)</hi> becauſe there the Holy Father beheld the Seven Stars: to <hi>Mirre (mons amaritudinis)</hi> becauſe of their ſevere diſcipline and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of life: to Mount <hi>Sion, Tabor,</hi> and <hi>Olivet,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe are the uſual Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons, chiefly founded upon their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Notes of Humour and Fancy.</p>
                     <p>As for the number Seven, it muſt not paſs without ſome figurative Comment. Theſe are the Seven Angels with the Seven Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,<note place="margin">Rev. 8.6.</note>
to declare War and Deſtruction to the ſinful World. The Seven Steps that were ſeen in <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Viſion; the Seven Candleſticks to enlighten the World; and laſtly the Eyes of the Lamb.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall not farther take notice of their playing with this wiſe number, but proceed to their Orders.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="10" facs="tcp:49566:30"/>They are obliged to wear Shirts made of Hair: never to feed upon fleſh: on Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days to eat nothing but bread and water: to live aſunder in particular Cells; and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to have their Diet ſingly brought them: except on ſome certain Feſtival days, when they dine together: not to entertain any Converſe with each other, but upon ſtatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table times: none to go out of the Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry but the Superior and Procurator, and they only to ſolicit the concerns of the Covent: from this rigorous way of Life, ſome imagine the name of their Order to be derived from <hi>Caro tuſa,</hi> now <hi>Cartuſe,</hi> from their Auſterities and Mortification of the Fleſh.</p>
                     <p>Their Habit is a white looſe Coat, with a Cowl of the ſame; but when they go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, they have a Caſe of black Stuff o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it: their Heads are ſhaved, juſt as the <hi>Benedictines</hi> are: Their particular Cells are low built, and do contain three or four ſeveral Rooms, on the ground-floor only; having behind each of them a little Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den environed with a high Wall: their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et is brought to them by Lay-brothers, and put in at a little Door in the Wall, near the entrance thereof: unto which there is a Lock, the Key whereof is kept by him that ſerves them. At the Hours of Publick
<pb facs="tcp:49566:30"/>
Prayers they meet in the Quire: Women are not permitted to come within the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts of their Monaſtery; nor a man to ſpeak with any of them, without ſpecial li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe given by the Superior. The Lay Brothers are not ſhaven, but their Hair on the Head is cut ſhort, and round, their Habit being the ſame with the Monks, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Scapular; which reacheth but a little below the middle, and is girt cloſe to them.</p>
                     <p>Which Inſtitution by <hi>Bruno</hi> was, as <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lydore</hi> affirms in the Year 1080. but others, upon better grounds, affirm in 1084. As to their Diurnal and Nocturnal Offices, they obſerve the Rule of St. <hi>Benedict.</hi> As for their Number, they have not anciently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded Thirteen, in any one Convent: they often glory in this Number upon theſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts: As firſt, becauſe it includes the Decalogue and Trinity: then it bears an alluſion to <hi>Jacob</hi> and his Sons: as alſo to our Bleſſed Saviour and his twelve Diſciples. This Order frequently I find liſted under the Patronage of St. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Edv.</hi> 3. <hi>Anno</hi> 11<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. He was ſent Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour to the French King; which was no
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49566:33"/>
mean Imployment for him, either as he was a Gentleman or a Stranger: In this Voyage he couragiouſly lands his men on the Iſle of <hi>Agnes,</hi> on purpoſe to revenge the Death of ſome Engliſh men, who not long before were ſlain by the Inhabitants, when they came for freſh water: Here he made a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſlaughter; and takes the Earl of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> his Brother, Captain of the Iſland, Priſoner.</p>
                     <p>His next martial performance, was in company of <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Derby,</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> into <hi>Gaſcoign</hi> and <hi>Guyen:</hi> where theſe two only attended with Five hundred men at Arms, and ſome few Archers, did mighty things, vanquiſht the Enemy, and recover'd many walled Towns and Caſtles.</p>
                     <p>It chanced that the Counteſs of <hi>Montfort,</hi> Siſter to <hi>Louis</hi> Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> like an undaunted Virago, put on Armour, and leads and encourages her People, to repell the common Foe: She deſires aid of the King of <hi>England,</hi> and hath it granted under the conduct of no leſs a man, than the Lord <hi>Walter de Manny:</hi> Not long after, the King himſelf fighting with the French, that he might not be known in Perſon, puts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and the Prince under the Colours and Defence of the ſame Invincible Warriour. This may ſuffice for a ſmall deſcription of

his Strength and Valour, I ſhall now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the occaſion of this ſingular Inſtance of his Piety and Beneficence.</p>
                     <p>He lived in an Age wherein all things ſeemed as wonderful as himſelf: <hi>Ann.</hi> 1345. on the Converſion of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> a great Earthquake ſhook <hi>Germany,</hi> wherewith many Villages and Caſtles fell down, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Stones mixt with Rain fell out of the Air: Moreover, the ſame day many pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and private Houſes fell at <hi>Venice:</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the Earth was ſhaken more or leſs fifteen days: whereof it hapned that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all Women with Child were delivered before their time. And after this a noyſom Peſtilence (called <hi>Inguinaria</hi>) invaded the People; the venom of the Diſeaſe was ſo deadly, that ſcarce one in an hundred e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped alive. It began firſt in <hi>Scythia,</hi> there raged along the Coaſts of the Sea <hi>Pontus</hi> and <hi>Helleſpont;</hi> at length through <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Illyria,</hi> it came into <hi>Italy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1346. A great Vapour coming from the North-part, to the great fear of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, was ſeen in the Air, and fell on the Earth. And the ſame year certain ſmall Beaſts in great number fell from the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Eaſt; through whoſe corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſtench there enſued a great Plague, which for three years reigned over the

whole World: Firſt creeping into <hi>Aſia,</hi> from <hi>India;</hi> was vehement in <hi>England, Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, Germany,</hi> and all <hi>Europe:</hi> The Jews were thought guilty of it, by poiſoning Fountains, and therefore they were burned every where.</p>
                     <p>1349. The Eighth of the Calends of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>br.</hi> in <hi>Noricum,</hi> on that ſide it is joyned with <hi>Pannonia, Illyrium, Dalmatia, Carinthia,</hi> and <hi>Iſtria;</hi> there was a great Earthquake in the Evening, which laſted forty days: Six Cities and Caſtles were overthrown, and ſwallowed up. In <hi>London</hi> the Plague was ſo vehement, that in a place called <hi>Charter-houſe-yard,</hi> were buried of the better ſort of People Sixty thouſand, ſays <hi>Cambden</hi> in his <hi>Britannia.

                     <head>An Account of <hi>Sutton</hi>'s Foundation, with his Life and Death.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>THOMAS SUTTON</hi> Eſquire, Founder of King <hi>James</hi> his Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in the <hi>Charter-houſe,</hi> was born at <hi>Knaith</hi> in <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> in the year of our Lord 1531. which was the Four and twentieth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth.</p>
                     <p>Though he was born, rather to give Honour to his Family, than to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row any from it; yet his Blood was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed to him through many noble <hi>Saxon</hi> Veins, in <hi>Cheſhire, Lancaſhire,</hi> and <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſterſhire:</hi> For, notwithſtanding the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> and the <hi>Norman Conqueſts,</hi> yet in the time of the latter, we find one of this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily Sherif in thoſe Parts, a Perſon of a fair and honourable eſteem in the World: And this advantage a Man well deſcended has above all others, unleſs he degenerate, that the Great Actions of his <hi>Anceſtors</hi> will
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49566:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not let him ſleep until he has outdone the Original.</p>
                     <p>The Courſe of this Ancient Family (like the River <hi>Alpheus</hi>) a while ran ſilently under Ground, while at laſt it ſprang up in <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, under <hi>Dudley,</hi> as notorious for Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and Exactions, as our <hi>Founder</hi> is for Mercy and Compaſſion.</p>
                     <p>His Father was <hi>Edward Sutton,</hi> Son of <hi>Thomas Sutton,</hi> Servant to <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth. His Mother was <hi>Jane Stapleton,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Robert Stapleton</hi> Eſquire, of the moſt Generous and Worthy Family of the <hi>Stapleton</hi>'s in <hi>Yorkſhire. Anceſtours,</hi> not ſo low, that his Deſcent ſhould be a ſhame to his Vertues; nor yet ſo great, but that his Vertue might be an <hi>Ornament</hi> to his Birth.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Cox</hi> (afterwards Dr. <hi>Cox, Almoner</hi> to King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, and Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> under Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>) brought him up three years at <hi>Eaton,</hi> four years in <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen</hi> and <hi>Jeſus</hi> Colledges in <hi>Cambridge;</hi> to each of whoſe Children, ſurviving at his Death, Mr. <hi>Sutton</hi> gave 10 <abbr>
                           <hi>l.</hi>
                        </abbr> for a Legacy: and as a thankful Acknowledgment of the Benefits he received from thoſe places of good Learning, he nobly bequeathed 500 to each Colledge.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="39" facs="tcp:49566:44"/>Soon after he was placed in <hi>Lincolns-Inne,</hi> as a Student, that he might want no part of Learning becoming a Gentleman. Not long after, almoſt tired with a Seden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary life, deſire of Travel increaſing with his Knowledge, he went to viſit <hi>Forreign Nations,</hi> and obtained the perfection of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Languages.</p>
                     <p>Half of a year he tarries in <hi>Spain,</hi> two in <hi>Italy,</hi> one in <hi>France,</hi> and then he paſſes into <hi>Holland,</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries;</hi> from whence, after a year or two ſpent in the <hi>Italian Wars</hi> (for he was at the Sacking of <hi>Rome,</hi> under the Duke of <hi>Bourbon</hi>) he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, accompliſh't with experience and obſervation: Then he was admitted to the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi>'s ſervice. To the former he was a Steward, to the latter a Secretary; and to both he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved himſelf ſo able and faithful, that they declared him fit for more Publique Imployments: as after appear'd by their helping him to Farm the Northern Coal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines, and that upon no other Security than his own Word.</p>
                     <p>He was quickly ſpy'd out by his wiſe and noble Soveraign Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (one, who knew where to beſtow her Favours, and who deſerved her Bounty) by her he was made <hi>Maſter of the Ordnance</hi> at <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi>
                        <pb n="40" facs="tcp:49566:45"/>
which Office he enjoyed Fourteen years; in token whereof there are two Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Ordnance carved in Stone, and ſet upon the Chimney-piece, in the great Hall in the <hi>Charter-houſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then he was choſen Pay-Maſter to the Northern Army; and afterwards one of the Commiſſioners for the Sequeſtration of the Lands of the Northern Rebels: in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to whom, he ſhewed himſelf a wiſe Man in diſpoſing ſo advantageouſly of the <hi>Berwick</hi> Forces: And a valiant Man in his Actions and Conduct.</p>
                     <p>Some years after he became Victualler to the Navy, and ſome Garriſons in the <hi>Low-Countries;</hi> one of which was <hi>Oſtend,</hi> which, by the help of ſome Fiſhermen, he relieved very ſtrangely, and to his own great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: to which Town he left in his Will 100 <abbr>
                           <hi>l.</hi>
                        </abbr>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, he was a Commiſſioner for Prizes, under the Earl of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> Lord High Admiral of <hi>England,</hi> who gave him Letters of Mart againſt the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> from whom he took a Ship richly laden, worth Twenty thouſand pounds.</p>
                     <p>Having by theſe profitable Imploys laid the Foundation of a good Eſtate, upon ſome miſ-underſtanding between him and the Northern Nobility, he retires to <hi>London,</hi>
                        <pb n="41" facs="tcp:49566:45"/>
to enjoy and improve it; where his Riches increaſed, and came upon him like a Tyde, by the juſt Arts and Methods which he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
                     <p>He brought with him to <hi>London</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of a mighty monied Man, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that it was reported, That his Purſe returned from the North fuller than Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Exchequer: (here he was made a Freeman, Citizen, and Girdler of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>)</p>
                     <p>His Payments were thought as ſure as her Penſions; the readineſs of his money, and the fairneſs of his dealing, laid the grounds of a mighty Reputation; for now he is look't upon by all men, he has the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal of the beſt Bargains, of Sales, and Mortgages, which were more frequent in a dead time of Money, as that was. Here poſſibly he got acquaintance with ſeveral Lords Servants, whom he remembers in <hi>his laſt Will,</hi> and piouſly relieves them.</p>
                     <p>He was alſo reſorted to by Citizens for mony; and indeed Mr. <hi>Sutton</hi> became the Banker of <hi>London:</hi> being called upon ſo much, that he was perſwaded to help others too, in the putting out of their mony. Once he thought of ſetting up a Bank in <hi>London,</hi> like that in <hi>Amſterdam;</hi> where People might take up mony, at ſo moderate an Intereſt,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49566:46"/>
as ſhould not eat out their Labour, nor waſte the heart and life of Trade, by making the care, pains, and ingenuity of the Borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſweat, and toyl, for the ſole benefit of the Lender: Therefore he lodged a 100 <abbr>
                           <hi>l.</hi>
                        </abbr>
in ſome honeſt mens hands to lend to poor people, weekly or monthly, by ſmall ſums upon good pawns, while he lived; and when he dyed, he left 1000 <abbr>
                           <hi>l.</hi>
                        </abbr> to the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>London,</hi> to be yearly lent to Ten young Trades-men without Uſe. Beſides, he ordered his Executors to abate half a years Intereſt to all his Debtors, when they call'd in his mony.</p>
                     <p>Thus did this great Man wax rich and known, which made him to ſome evil-minded perſons, the object of Envy: and he finds not the Shadow of that Charity in the World, which he ſhew'd in Subſtance and Reality.</p>
                     <p>Some urge that he ſerved himſelf too much upon the hopes many had entertained of being his Heirs: by receiving thoſe Gifts, which ſome covetous Friends, <hi>miſerunt in hamô,</hi> by eaſily purchaſing thoſe Lands which they expected ſhould return with Intereſt. I do not underſtand the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable preſumption of men, to name and adopt themſelves their Neighbours Heirs, and, if they confirm it not, they ſhall be
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49566:46"/>
branded with Injuſtice: The Wiſdom of the Serpent is as well required, as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency of the Dove. He that ſtrives to outreach his Friend, is juſtly caught in his own Snares.</p>
                     <p>Others ſtrongly believe he was the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>Ben. Johnſon</hi>'s mirth: Which (if it were true) is no real Scandal to this good Man, when all things juſt and honourable, ſacred and of good report, are ſhamefully expoſed to the lewd affronts of a bold and licentious Stage. Beſides, 'tis probable the Poet never intended what they think. For in that Age ſeveral other men were pointed at, and who was the true Perſon, was then a matter of doubt. If the Poet deſign'd to injure the Fame of <hi>Sutton,</hi> he was firſt of all an ungrateful Wretch, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe thoſe hands which afforded him Bread, for he allowed him a conſtant Penſion: And ſecondly, he diſowned his very Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing, which he ſent to our Founder, in Vindication of himſelf in this matter.</p>
                     <p>In the late unhappy times, another ſort of Enemy appears, and will hardly ſuffer this pious Benefactor to lye quiet in his Grave: The Revenue made a great noiſe, and prov'd ſomething melodious to the ears of the commanding Party; therefore they endeavour to find out a way to ſubvert the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49566:47"/>
Houſe, Foundation and all. No better Plea than the old Popular Argument (uſed before againſt his Sacred Majeſty <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, of ever bleſſed memory) <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, Popery:</hi> 'Tis preſently whiſper'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, <hi>That</hi> Sutton <hi>dyed a Papiſt; That the Houſe was built upon naughty, Popiſh ground; That all the Walls were full of Tapers and Croſſes; That it was deſigned to Jeſuitical ends and Purpoſes; That there was a great Vault underneath, which reach't almoſt to</hi> Iſlington, <hi>and (for ought they knew) it might be full of Powder and Malignants, Plots and Superſtition, all conſpiring againſt the Good Old Cauſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At this time, <hi>Edward Creſſet</hi> Maſter of the Hoſpital, by his Intereſt in that Party, interpoſed, and laid that ſtorm, for which he received publick Thanks from the Lords the Governours, <hi>Anno</hi> 1660.</p>
                     <p>This Freak hardly deſerves conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, eſpecially proceeding from that ſort of men. Mr. <hi>Sutton</hi> was too well known for this Project to take effect: He was an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and Religious <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> conſtant and exemplary upon all occaſions at the Publick Service of God, regular and ſtrict in Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Duties, accuſtomed to Prayer, reading the Scriptures, and very ſolicitous in his choice of a Holy and Learned Chaplain:
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49566:47"/>
His thoughts were uſually Heaven-ward; in his Ejaculations frequently deſiring God, <hi>That as he had bountifully bleſſed him with a plentiful Eſtate, ſo he would be pleaſed to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect him in the diſpoſal of it.</hi> This he has been often over-heard to ſay, walking in his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. His Thoughts were not only Divine, but his uſual Company were Miniſters of God's Word; for there is no Writing ſcarce of his, to which there is not the hand of a Divine or two: Or elſe he viſited the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs and Widows, the Impotent and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent, and in a great meaſure kept himſelf unſpotted from the World.</p>
                     <p>Now that which ſeems moſt wonderful is this, That men profeſſing the Proteſtant Religion, ſhould indeavour to pull down one of the greateſt Monuments of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion, it being the common Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument whereby we uſe to prevent the Papiſts extravagant Relations of Good Works.</p>
                     <p>Had he been a Red-letter Man, Mr. <hi>Knott</hi> the Jeſuite (in his Anſwer to Dr. <hi>Potter</hi>'s Book, called <hi>Charity Miſtaken</hi>) would never have vented this following Reproach: <hi>But he muſt be crucified between theſe two:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Do your Hoſpitals deſerve ſo much as to be named? Have you any thing of that kind,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49566:48"/>
in effect, of particular note? ſaving the few mean Nurſeries of idle Beggars, and debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched People; except</hi> Sutton<hi>'s Hoſpital, which (as I have been informed) was to receive no profit, till his death: who alſo dyed without Children, Brother, Siſter, or known Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; ſo that per adventure, it was eſcheated to the King,</hi> &amp;c. At length he ſays, <hi>He could tell us of the Annunciata at</hi> Naples, <hi>which ſpends Three hundred thouſand Crowns,</hi> viz. <hi>above Eight thouſand pounds,</hi> per Annum, <hi>feeds and cures One thouſand ſick perſons; Nurſes and entertains Three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Sucking-children, &amp;c.</hi> Then he gives a hint of another famous Hoſpital in <hi>Rome,</hi> called <hi>Sancto Spirito.</hi> To both which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi> does as reproachfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, by ſaying, <hi>That the Infamous Diſeaſe of</hi> Naples <hi>might well cauſe the erection of ſo mighty a Structure; and as for that at</hi> Rome, <hi>the wonderful plenty of unlawful Iſſues, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren baſely born, did require ſo great a Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I queſtion not but both are too blame for where ever we find any ſparks of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and piety, though they lodge in the breaſt of a Turk or Jew, Papiſt or Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, yet it is but common Juſtice to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford every man his due praiſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="47" facs="tcp:49566:48"/>'Tis eaſie alſo to diſcover the Jeſuit's mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes: for firſt Mr. <hi>Sutton</hi> intended to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide upon his Benefaction, as Maſter of it; though it pleaſed God ſooner to take him to himſelf, to admit him into the <hi>Land of Promiſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then his Kindred were known far and near, for <hi>Simon Baxter,</hi> Son of his Siſter <hi>Dorothy,</hi> endeavoured to overthrow the Settlement of the Eſtate, as being next Heir in Law; as after may be ſeen at large.</p>
                     <p>His other Objections concerning penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs, ſhall be anſwered in another place. Here now I could to purpoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminate, but that I am ſenſible it is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuous and uncharitable; and widens the Breaches of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let the froward World endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame and calumniate, to beſpatter all that is good and laudable; yet certainly, we ought to riſe up in the Vindication of him, who taught us to ſpeak, to proclaim his Charity by which we live; to commend that Temperance, which affords us affluence and plenty; to admire his Self-denyal, who was to do little leſs than a <hi>Miracle,</hi> to feed a Multitude.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="48" facs="tcp:49566:49"/>There are few ſuch Uſurers who deſign to receive their intereſt in Heaven; few ſuch <hi>Benefactors,</hi> whoſe comprehenſive Bounty embraces all Mankind, from the Cradle almoſt, to the grayeſt Head; from the tender and helpleſs Youth, to the moſt Impotent and Infirm old Age.</p>
                     <p>Had our Founder gained that by unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Uſury, which he diſpoſed to pious uſes (which is a ſin almoſt to ſuppoſe, unleſs we had evidence) yet Reſtitution is the beſt ſign, and the greateſt teſtimonial of ſincere Repentance; and where particular Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution cannot be made to the parties wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, God requires it ſhould be given to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the poor.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Zacheus, Luke</hi> 19.8. upon his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Converſion, made an Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Reſtauration to all that he had wronged, nay fourfold, and gave half of his Eſtate to Souls that were in want; this is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded for our Example.</p>
                     <p>But this Accuſation can lay no hold on Mr. <hi>Sutton;</hi> for his Eſtate was gotten by Trade and Offices, and never laid out for Intereſt until his years admoniſhed him to quit his buſineſs, and leave it for younger and more active people, who could not undertake it unleſs he lent them mony: and what Injury did he to any man to let him
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49566:49"/>
have that at 6 <abbr>
                           <hi>l.</hi>
                        </abbr> 
                        <hi>per Cent.</hi> which he was able to improve to 30 or 40 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Beſides in his latter time his mony was chiefly laid out upon Annuities.</p>
                     <p>It was obſerved, that when he lent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, he would enquire how it was ſpent, and if he found that it was laid out for Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, Food, and Rayment, he never could be perſwaded to take any Uſe. No doubt but he roſe by the Steps of Thrift and Frugality, by being diligent in a lawful Calling; nor was he Prodigal becauſe he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be Magnificent.</p>
                     <p>Obſerve this Story which is told of his Parſimony: Whilſt he was buſied in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Trade and Commerce with other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he contracted a Familiar Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with a Merchant, his Companion in Travel; who, though he did equal <hi>Sutton</hi> in Trade, yet had not ſo well learned the Elements of Thrift: For when on a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, he called for his Pint of Wine, <hi>Sutton</hi> called for a Gill: and for every other Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor doubled the Quantity. At length this Merchant dyes, and by Computation leaves an Eſtate of Fifty thouſand pounds; which Report coming to <hi>Sutton</hi>'s Ears, he ſaid, <hi>Alas! I alwaies pitied him, I thought he would dye no rich man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This was, in the perſon of his Friend, to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49566:50"/>
correct the Surfets and Extravagancies of a Profuſe Age: For a rich man is no way hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier than another man, but that he has more Opportunities miniſtred unto him of doing more good than his Neighbours. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Diogenes</hi> ask't of the Thrifty man but a half penny, of the Prodigal a pound; the former, he ſaid, might give him often, but the latter would ſhortly have nothing to give. <hi>Good Husbandry</hi> is the fuel of Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality. He choſe rather to deny himſelf in his Superfluities, to retrench vain Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that he might be able to refreſh others in their day of ſorrow; not to rake from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wants, that he might riot, and rejoyce in their miſeries.</p>
                     <p>The Fame and Credit of our Generous <hi>Founder,</hi> brought him to ſhare in many Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices at the <hi>Court,</hi> and at the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe,</hi> where they had occaſion for his mony: for when an Induſtrious man has once rais'd his Fortunes to a conſiderable pitch, he there grows rich apace, by ſharing in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Labours of many of the under ſort of men.</p>
                     <p>He was a ſharer in ſeveral publick Farms, a Partner in Forreign Adventures, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in <hi>Muſcovy</hi> and <hi>Hamburgh;</hi> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that he had no leſs than Thirty Agents abroad.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="51" facs="tcp:49566:50"/>Thus he toyl'd and wrought, as if he co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>veted all; and gave away, and he deſired nothing: He looked upon himſelf a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Sutton,</hi> according to the Methods of Wiſe men, who mean to be wealthy, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Ordinary Expences to be but half of his Incomes, when they were at the loweſt; and when they increaſed he ordered a third part, and at the higheſt, he determined to be charitable to an eighth part, or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, while living: When his Eſtate was Two thouſand pound <hi>per Ann.</hi> he deſigned one Thouſand for himſelf and Family, in Houſe-keeping and Board-wages; Two or Three hundred pounds for Charity; Four hundred pounds for Law and Phyſick, and many other neceſſaries; the reſt for extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Emergencies, not thinking it any way diſhonourable, to have a Perſonal Inſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction over his own Affairs.</p>
                     <p>He was happy in a Wife, as well as Eſtate, which was advanced by her near Twenty thouſand pounds. She was the Lady

                        <hi>Popham,</hi> and ſo enjoyed the Wealth of great Rich <hi>Popham.</hi> He had no Iſſue by his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Wife, for God Almighty had deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him a numerous train of Children, to be adopted into his Family, and nurſed up ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, as if they came from his own Loyns.</p>
                     <p>His Addreſſes were manly and taking, his Diſcourſe clear and full of Eloquence: He did not interrupt his Reſolutions with fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and too much caution, nor deprive himſelf of the great <hi>Inſtrument</hi> of Action, <hi>Truſt,</hi> or <hi>Belief.</hi> Theſe good Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with the glad Circumſtances of a large Fortune, and a long Age, near 80 years, in a <hi>Peaceable</hi> and <hi>Flouriſhing Reign</hi> (after the troubleſome days of Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the late unhappy Rebellion) could not but conſpire to make him Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                     <p>The Benefices that were in his Patronage, he dearly bought, that he might beſtow them upon men fit to be <hi>burning</hi> and <hi>ſhining Lights</hi> in the <hi>Church of God;</hi> One of which Divines was Dr. <hi>Fiſh</hi> of <hi>Hallingbury</hi> in <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex,</hi> who has often teſtified Mr. <hi>Sutton</hi>'s In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity in this point: He received his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of Him, <hi>Ann. Dom.</hi> 1610. and heard him ſay, <hi>That he never deſired any thing of a Miniſter of Gods Word, but his
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49566:51"/>
Prayers, and the due performance of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He was a good Pariſhioner where he had Land and no Living; as well as a good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron where he had both: encouraging all People by his early preſence at Church; doing good Offices, as repairing Churches, and decently adorning thoſe holy Places, <hi>where God has ſaid his Name ſhall dwell.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He was remarkable for the Compaſſion and Relief he beſtowed on the Widows and Children of good Miniſters: and this more particularly incited to by the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Examples he had ſeen of Charity of this Nature in the <hi>Low-Countries.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He was very Temperate, moderating his natural Appetite by Abſtinence; he was ſober and vigilant, and moderate in all his Recreations: The outward Ornaments of his Body were clean and becoming, neither ſtarch't or curious, neither careleſs or nice. Theſe were not ſo properly the Comforts of his Soul, as the Sweetneſs of his Life; hence proceeded health of Body, clean Strength, a good Complexion, and a grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and treatable Diſpoſition.</p>
                     <p>As a Maſter, he was careful and diligent to enquire how his Servants performed their Labours, for the duſt of the Maſter's Shoos, is the compoſt to improve the Soyl:
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49566:52"/>
and his Love appeared to his Servants by making a comfortable proviſion for them; for at this day, many of the Tenants to the Houſe, are deſcended from thoſe who were Servants to the <hi>Founder;</hi> and the common Reaſon they give of their good Bargains, is; <hi>That they hold them as Rewards of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors Service.</hi> Yet it lies in the power of the <hi>Governors</hi> to advance the Rent, which in ſome places has been done, though with great moderation; and this rather to quicken than diſhearten the Tenants.</p>
                     <p>It is not intended by this Character of Mr. <hi>Sutton,</hi> that he ſhould be free from all blemiſh; that he ſhould be another <hi>Bona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, in whom,</hi> ſome affirm, <hi>Adam did not ſin.</hi> All things have a mixture of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption here below, nay, it is riveted in our very Nature: The faireſt Figure muſt have ſome flaws, and the moſt beautiful Image ſome unhappy ſtrokes; therefore he, as all other men, was ſubject to the like Paſſions: Whatever were his failings, common Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſhould endeavour to hide his Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, who was content to ſpread his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments over ſo great a multitude.</p>
                     <p>After a numerous train of Worthy and Religious Actions, in a good old Age, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in One of 80 years, he dy'd at <hi>Hackney,</hi> in the County of <hi>Middleſex, Decemb.</hi> 12. <hi>Ann.

He had for ſome time laboured under a Feveriſh Diſtemper, which waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him away, and brought him into a ling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Conſumption; this, attended with frequent and ſharp fits of the Stone, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent aſſaults of the Colick, made him Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render up his Soul to that God, on whoſe power the Life of all Depends.</p>

Let us now conſider what particular Motives were apply'd to perſwade and mould the mind of this good Man to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign this Great <hi>Benefaction:</hi> as alſo what Objections and Inconveniences were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to hinder the Progreſs of the Work.</p>
                     <p>Dr. <hi>Willet,</hi> who lived at <hi>Barkway,</hi> not far from Mr. <hi>Sutton,</hi> and was much conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him, would often ſay, <hi>That his Thoughts had eaten his Bowels, had he not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſom'd ſome of them to his Friends.</hi> The Doctor adviſed him to be a Benefactor to <hi>Chelſey Colledge;</hi> a Place intended for the convenience and maintenance of Learned Divines, who ſhould ſtudy and write Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies againſt the Papiſts, Erected <hi>Ann.

Dr. <hi>Sutcliff</hi> Dean of <hi>Exceter,</hi> was the firſt Maſter; Mr. <hi>William Gambden</hi> Clarencieux, and Mr. <hi>John Heywood</hi> Dr. in Law, Hiſtorians, were fellows of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: The Reverſion of ſome Lands in <hi>Chelſey,</hi> held in Leaſe by the Earl of <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham,</hi> was all the Encouragement this Colledge found; whoſe Endowment Dr. <hi>Willet</hi> propoſed to Mr. <hi>Sutton,</hi> or the ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a new Colledge to that purpoſe of his own.</p>
                     <p>Another Propoſition of the Doctors was taken out of King <hi>James</hi> his Letter to the

I crave not your pardon, but your acceptation: It is no preſumption to give good Counſel, and Preſents of Love fear not to be ill taken of Strangers: my Pen and your Subſtance are both given us for one end, to do good: theſe are our Talents, how happy are we, if we can improve them well! ſuffer me to do you good with the one, that with the other you may do good to many, and moſt to your ſelf: you cannot but know, that your full hand and worthy purpoſes have poſſeſſed the World with much expectation: What ſpeak I of the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49566:55"/>
World! whoſe honeſt and reaſonable claims yet cannot be contemned with honour, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed with diſhonour. The God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hath lent you this abundance, and given you theſe gracious thoughts of Charity, of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, looks long for the Iſsue of both, and will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily complain of too little, or too late: your Wealth and your Will are both good; but the firſt is only made good by the ſecond: for if your hand were full, and your heart empty, we, who now applaud you, ſhould juſtly pity you: you might have Riches, not Goods, not Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings; your Burden ſhould be greater than your Eſtate, and you ſhould be richer in ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, than in metals. For (if we look to no other world) what gain is it to be keeper of the beſt Earth? that which is the common Coffer of all the rich Mines, we do but tread upon; and account it vile, becauſe it doth but hold and hide thoſe Treaſures: whereas the skilfulleſt Metalliſt, that findeth and refineth thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Veines for Publique uſe, is rewarded, is honoured: the very baſeſt Element yields Gold. The Savage <hi>Indian</hi> gets it, the Servile Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice works it, the very <hi>Midianitiſh</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel may wear it; the miſerable worldling ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires it, the covetous Jew ſwallows it, the unthrifty Ruffian ſpends it; what are all theſe the better for it? only good uſe gives praiſe to Earthly Poſſeſſions: hearing therefore you

owe more to God, that he hath given you an heart to do good: a will to be as rich in good Works, as great in Riches; to be a Friend to this Mammon, is to be an enemy to God; but to make Friends with it is Royal and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an: His Enemies may be wealthy, none but his Friends can either be good, or do good: <hi>Da &amp; acc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

God, who hath all gives all; reſerves nothing: and for himſelf he well conſiders, that God hath not made him an owner, but a ſervant; and a ſervant of ſervants not of his goods, but of the giver: Not a Treaſurer, but a Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, whoſe praiſe is more, to have laid out well, than to have received much: The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt gain therefore that he affects, is an even reckoning, a clear diſcharge: which ſince it is obtained by diſpoſing, not by keeping, he counts reſervation loſs, and juſt expence his trade, and joy. He knows, that <hi>well done faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> is a thouſand times more ſweet a Note, than <hi>Soul take thine eaſe:</hi> for that is the voice of the Maſter recompenſing; this of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant preſuming: and what follows to the one, but his Maſter's joy? and what to the other, but the loſs of his Soul? Bleſſed be that God, which hath given you an heart to fore-think this, and in this dry and dead Age a will to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49566:56"/>
honour him with his own; and to credit his Goſpel with your Beneficence. Lo! we are upbraided with barrenneſs: your name hath been publickly oppoſed to theſe challenges; as in whom it ſhall be ſeen, that the truth hath friends, that can give: I neither diſtruſt nor perſwade you, whoſe Reſolutions are happily fixed on purpoſes of good; only give me leave to haſten your pace a little, and to excite your Chriſtian forwardneſs to begin ſpeedily, what you have long and conſtantly vowed. You would not but do good, why not now? I ſpeak boldly the more ſpeed, the more comfort: neither are the times in our diſpoſal, nor our ſelves. If God had ſet us a Day, and made our Wealth inſeparable, there were no danger in delaying now our uncertainty either muſt quicken us, or may deceive us. How many have meant well and done nothing, and loſt the Crown with lingring? whoſe deſtinies have prevented their deſires; and have their good motions the wards of their Executors; not without miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſucceſs: to whom, that they would have done good, is not ſo great a praiſe, as it is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, that they might have done it: then Wrecks are our Warnings: we are equally mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, equally fickle. Why have you this reſpite of living, but to prevent the Imperious neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Death? It is a woful and remedileſs complaint, the end of our days hath overrun
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49566:56"/>
the beginning of our good Works: Early be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence hath no danger; many joys: for the conſcience of good done, the Prayers and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the Relieved, and the Gratulations of Saints, are as ſo many perpetual Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which can make our life pleaſant, and our death happy; our evil days good, our good better: all theſe are but loſt with delay: few and cold are the Prayers for him that may give: and in lieu, our good purpoſes foreſlow'd are become our tormentors: upon our Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed little difference is betwixt good deferr'd, and evil done: good was meant, who hindred it? will our Conſcience ſay: There was time enough, means enough, need enough, what hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd? did fear of envy, diſtruſt of want? alas! what Buggs are theſe to fright men from Heaven? as if the envy of keeping were leſs than beſtowing: as if God were not as good a Debtor, as a Giver. <hi>He that gives to the Poor, lends to the Lord,</hi> ſays <hi>Solomon.</hi> If he freely give us what we may lend, and grace to give, will he not much more pay us what we have lent? and give us, becauſe we have given? that is his bounty, this is his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: O happy is the man that may be a Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor to his Maker! Heaven and Earth ſhall empty, before he want a Royal Payment: if we dare not truſt God while we live, how dare we truſt men, when we are dead? Men, that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49566:57"/>
are ſtill deceitful, and light upon the Balance: light of truth, and heavy of ſelf-love: how many Executors have proved the Execution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of honeſt Wills? how many have our eyes ſeen, that after moſt careful choice of Truſty Guardians, have had their Children and Goods ſo diſpoſed, as if the Parents Soul could return to ſee it, I doubt whether it would be happy: How rare is that man, who prefers not himſelf to his dead Friend, profit to truth? who will take no advantage of the Impoſſibility of the account? Whatever therefore men ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhew or promiſe, happy is that man that may be his own Auditor, Superviſor, Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: as you love God and your Self, be not aefraid of being happy too ſoon. I am not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to give ſo bold advice, let the Wiſeman <hi>Syrach</hi> ſpeak for me; <hi>Do good before thou dye, and according to thine ability ſtretch out thine hand, and give: defraud not thy ſelf of thy good day; and let not the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy good deſires paſs over thee: Shalt thou not leave thy travels to another, and thy labours to them that will divide thy Heritage?</hi> Or let a wiſer than he ſpeak, <hi>viz.</hi> Solomon: <hi>Say not, to morrow I will give, if thou now have it: for thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not what a day will bring forth.</hi> It hath been an old Rule of Liberality, <hi>He gives twice, who gives quickly:</hi> whereas ſlow
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49566:57"/>
benefits argue uncheerfulneſs, and loſe their worth: who lingers his receipts, is condemned as unthrifty: he who knoweth both, ſaith, <hi>It is better to give, than to receive.</hi> If we are of the ſame ſpirit, why are we haſly in the worſt, and ſlack in the better? Suffer you your ſelf therefore, Good Sir, for God's ſake, for the Goſpel's ſake, for the Church's ſake, for your Soul's ſake, to be ſtirred up by theſe poor lines, to a reſolute and ſpeedy performing of your worthy intentions. And take this as a loving Invitation ſent from Heaven, by an unworthy Meſſenger: you cannot deliberate long of fit Objects for your Beneficence, except it be more for multitude, than want: the Streets, yea, the World is full. How doth <hi>Lazarus</hi> lye at every door? how many Sons of the Prophets in their meanly provided Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, may ſay, not <hi>mors in ollâ,</hi> but <hi>fames?</hi> how many Churches may juſtly plead that which our Saviour bad his Diſciples, <hi>The Lord hath need?</hi> and if this infinite ſtore hath made your choice doubtful, how eaſie were it to ſhew you, wherein you might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige the whole Church of God to you? and make your memorial both eternal and bleſſed: or if you had rather, the whole Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth?</p>
                           <p>But now I find my ſelf too hold, and too buſie, in thus looking to particularities:
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49566:58"/>
God ſhall direct you, and if you follow him, ſhall Crown you. Howſoever, if good be done, and that betimes, He hath what he deſired, and your Soul ſhall have more than you can deſire.

                     <p>Never man received Advice more kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than Mr. <hi>Sutton,</hi> and bleſſed God for the return of his Prayers in the Garden. He never was inclinable to Dr. <hi>Willet</hi>'s former Propoſal, upon theſe accounts: he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Patrons of <hi>Chelſey</hi> Colledge were few, nor was his deſign to be an additional Benefactor, but a Founder. Beſides, he plainly ſaw thoſe Enemies to the work, who thought they lay in ſecret: and what was more, he perceived it was look't up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with a jealous Eye by the <hi>Univerſities,</hi> as a diſparagement to them. Then, other Divines and Churchmen thought they were undervalued, becauſe the Fellows of this Foundation were likely to gain Priviledges
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49566:58"/>
prejudicial to them. And laſtly, the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick States-men did diſlike the Project, ſuſpecting Court Divinity, and Hiſtory, from a Colledge. This is ſuppoſed to be the place meant by the <hi>Incomparable Cowley,</hi> in his excellent Inſtructions towards the Inſtitution of a Colledge.</p>
                     <p>Nor to add a City-Hoſpital could he be induced (though much ſolicited) the poor of thoſe places being likely to be well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, by the daily Legacies of ſuch, who were not in any capacity to do ſo great things as himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Being thus ſolicited by others to perform that, which he had long ſince reſolved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelf; and having obſerved how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hopeful Youths miſcarried for want of competent Means for their Education; and how many <hi>ancient Gentlemen,</hi> having the ſame tender Breeding with their Elder Brothers, yet have but the ſlender For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of a Younger Brother; that they were too generous to begg, not made for work (whoſe ingenuous Natures were moſt ſenſible of want, and leaſt able to relieve it) but were caſt away, and brought to miſery for want of a comfortable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence in their Old Age: Therefore he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to prevent, by his memorable Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as far as he could, theſe growing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49566:59"/>
The blind Devotion of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages had ſo abuſed the ends and deſigns of Charitable Works, that King <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt (as well as <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our) made a <hi>Law of Mortmain;</hi>) whereby it is made unlawful for any man to beſtow Land of ſuch a value to any Religious or Charitable uſe without licence from the King, of <hi>Mortmain</hi> in Parliament.</p>
                     <p>This Law of Amortization in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's time, much grieved many good men: For St. <hi>Jerome</hi> thus complains to <hi>Nepotian,</hi> I am aſhamed to ſay it, the Prieſts of Idols, Stage-players, and Common Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots, are made capable of Inheritance, and receiving Legacies, only Miniſters of the Goſpel are barred by the Law thus to do, and that not by Perſecutors, but Chriſtian Princes: neither do I complain of the Law, but am ſorry we have deſerved it. To the ſame purpoſe is that of St. <hi>Ambroſe, Ep.</hi> 31. deploring the State of the Clergy.</p>
                     <p>Upon the account of this Law, Mr. <hi>Sutton</hi> was forced to petition his Majeſty K. <hi>James</hi> and the Parliament, <hi>March</hi> 10. 1609. for leave and licence to erect and endow an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpital in the Town of <hi>Hallingbury Bouchers,</hi> in the County of <hi>Eſſex.</hi>

                                 <hi>I</hi> Find it a poſitive Precept in the Old Law, <hi>That there ſhould be no Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice without Salt:</hi> The Moral whereof (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Ceremony) may be, That God is not pleaſed with the Body of a good Intention, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be ſeaſoned with that Spiritual Wiſdom and Judgment, as it be not eaſily ſubject to be corrupted and perverted. For Salt in the Scripture is both a figure of Wiſdom, and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: this cometh into my mind, upon this act of Mr. <hi>Sutton,</hi> which ſeemeth to me as a Sacrifice without Salt; having the Materials of a good Intention, but not powdred with any ſuch Ordinances and Inſtitutions as may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſame from turning corrupt; or at
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:49566:74"/>
leaſt from becoming unſavory, and of little uſe: For though the choice of the Feoffees be of the beſt, yet neither can they always live; and the very nature of the work it ſelf, in the vaſt and unfit proportion thereof is apt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke a miſ-imployment: it is no diligence of theirs (except there be a digreſſion from that Model) that can excuſe it from running the ſame way that Gifts of the like condition have heretofore done: For to deſign the <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-houſe,</hi> a Building fit for a Prince<hi>'s</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, for an Hoſpital, is all one, as if one ſhould give in Alms, a rich embroydered Cloak to a Beggar: And certainly a man may ſee, <hi>tanquam quae oculis cernuntur,</hi> that if ſuch an Edifice, with Six thouſand pounds Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, be erected into one Hoſpital, it will in a ſmall time degenerate, to be made a prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome great Perſon to be Maſter, and he to take all the ſweet, and the Poor to be ſtinted, and take but the Crums; as it comes to paſs in divers Hoſpitals of this Realm, which have but the names of Hoſpitals, and are but wealthy Benefices, in reſpect of the Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; but the poor, which is the <hi>propter quid,</hi> little relieved: And the like hath been the Fortune of much of the Alms of the Roman Religion, in the Great Foundations, which being begun in Vain-glory and Oſtentation, have had their Judgment upon them to end
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49566:75"/>
in corruption and abuſe. This Meditation hath made me preſume to write theſe few Lines to your Majeſty, being no better than good wiſhes, which your Majeſties great Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, may make ſomething, or nothing of.</p>
                              <p>Wherein, I deſire to be thus underſtood, that if this Foundation (ſuch as it is) be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and good in Law: then I am too well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with your Majeſties Diſpoſition, to adviſe any courſe of power or profit, which is not grounded upon a right.</p>
                              <p>Nay further, if the defects be ſuch, as a Court of Equity may remedy and cure: Then I wiſh that, as St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Shadow did cure Diſeaſes, ſo the very ſhadow of a good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may cure the defects of that Nature: But if there be a Right, and Birthright plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Heir, and not remediable by Courts of Equity, and that Right be ſubmitted to your Majeſty, whereby it is both in your pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and grace what to do: then do I wiſh, that this rude Maſs and Chaos of a good Deed, were directed rather to a ſolid Merit, and durable Charity, than to a blaze of Glory, that will but crackle a little in Talk, and quickly extinguiſh: And this may be done, obſerving the Species of Mr. <hi>Sutton</hi>'s intent, though varying in <hi>individuo;</hi> for it appears that he had in notion, a triple good, an Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:49566:75"/>
a School, and maintaining of a Preacher; which individuals refer to theſe three Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Heads, Relief of the Poor, Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Learning, and Propagation of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Now then, if I ſet before your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, in every of theſe three kinds, what it is that is moſt wanting in your Kingdom, and what is like to be the moſt fruitful and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual uſe of ſuch a Beneficence, and leaſt like to be perverted; that, I think, ſhall be no ill ſcope of my labour, how meanly ſoever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; for out of Variety repreſented, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction may be beſt grounded.</p>
                              <p>Concerning the Relief of the Poor; I hold, ſome number of Hoſpitals, with competent Endowments, will do far more good than one Hoſpital of an Exorbitant Greatneſs: for though the one Courſe will be more ſeen, yet the other will be more felt: For if your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty erect many, beſides the obſerving of the ordinary Maxim, <hi>Bonum, quo communius, eò melius,</hi> choice may be made of thoſe Towns and places, where there is moſt need: and ſo the Remedy may be diſtributed as the Diſeaſe is diſperſed. Again, greatneſs of Relief ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulated in one place, doth rather invite a ſwarm and ſurcharge of poor, than relieve thoſe that are naturally bred in that place; like to ill temper'd Medicines, that draw more humour to the part, than they evacuate from
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:49566:76"/>
it: but chiefly I rely upon the Reaſon I touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the beginning, That in theſe great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitals, the Revenues will draw the Uſe, and not the Uſe the Revenues; and ſo through the Maſs of Wealth, they will ſwiftly tumble down in a miſ-employment. And if any man ſay, That in the two Hoſpitals in <hi>London,</hi> there is a Precedent of Greatneſs concurring with good Employment; let him conſider, that thoſe Hoſpitals have Annual Governours; that they are under the Superiour care and policy of ſuch a State, as the City of <hi>London;</hi> and chiefly, that their Revenues conſiſt not in Certainties, but in Caſualties and free Gifts: which Gifts would be withheld, if they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared once to be perverted; ſo as it keepeth them in a continual good behaviour and awe, to imploy them aright: None of which points do match with the preſent Caſe.</p>
                              <p>The next Conſideration may be, Whether this intended Hoſpital, as it hath a more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Endowment, than other Hoſpitals have, ſhould not likewiſe work upon a better Subject than other poor: as that it ſhould be converted to the relief of maimed Souldiers, decayed Merchants, Houſholders, aged and deſtitute Churchmen, and the like; whoſe Condition being of a better ſort than looſe People and Beggars, deſerveth both a more liberal ſtipend and allowance, and ſome proper place of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:49566:76"/>
not intermingled, or coupled with the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt ſort of poor; which Project, though ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, yet in my judgment will not anſwer the deſign in the event, in theſe our times: For certainly, few men in any Vocation, who have been Somebody, and bear a mind ſomewhat according to conſcience, and remembrance of that they have been, will ever condeſcend to that Condition, as to profeſs to live upon Alms, and to become a Corporation of declared Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars; but rather will chooſe to live obſcurely, and, as it were, to hide themſelves with ſome private Friends: So that the end of ſuch an Inſtitution will be, That it will make the place a receptacle of the worſt, idleſt, and moſt diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Perſons of every Profeſſion, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Cell of Loyterers, caſt Serving men, and Drunkards, with ſcandal, rather than fruit, to the Common-wealth: And of this kind, I can find but one Example with us, which is the Alms Knights of <hi>Windſor,</hi> which Particular would give a man ſmall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to follow that Precedent.</p>
                              <p>Therefore the beſt effect of Hoſpitals, is, to make the Kingdom, if it were poſſible, capable of that Law, <hi>That there be no Beggar in</hi> Iſrael: for it is that kind of People that is a Burden, an Eye ſore, a Scandal, and a Seed of peril and tumult in the State. But chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it were to be wiſht, that ſuch a Beneficence
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:49566:77"/>
towards the relief of the Poor, were ſo beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as not only the meer and naked Poor ſhould be ſuſtained; but alſo that the honeſt Perſon, which maketh hard means to live, upon whom the Poor are now charged, ſhould be in ſome ſort relieved: for that were a work generally acceptable to the Kingdom, if the publique Hand of Alms might ſpare the private hand of Tax: and therefore, of all other Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of that kind, I commend moſt, Houſes of Relief and Correction; which are mixt Hoſpitals, where the Impotent Perſon is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and the ſturdy Beggar buckled to work; and the unable Perſon alſo not maintained to be idle (which is ever joyned with Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Impurity) but is ſorted with ſuch work as he can manage and perform: and when the uſes are not diſtinguiſh't, as in other Hoſpitals, whereof ſome are for Aged and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, ſome for Children, and ſome for Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and Vagabonds, but are general and promiſcuous; ſo that they may take off Poor of every ſort from the Country, as the Country breeds them: And thus the Poor themſelves ſhall find the Proviſion, and other People the Sweetneſs of the abatement of the Tax.</p>
                              <p>Now if it be objected, That Houſes of Correction in all places have not done the good expected: as it cannot be denied, but in moſt places they have done much good; ſo it muſt be
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:49566:77"/>
remembred that there is a great difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that which is done by the diſtracted go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Juſtices of Peace, and that which may be done by a ſetled Ordinance, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to a regular Viſitation, as this may be: and beſides the want hath been commonly in Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Correction, of a competent and certain Stock for the Materials of Labour, which in this Caſe may be likewiſe ſupply'd.</p>
                              <p>Concerning the Advancement of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I do ſubſcribe to the Opinion of one of the wiſeſt and greateſt Men of your Kingdom, That for Grammar Schools, there are already too many, and therefore no Providence to add, where there is exceſs. For the great number of Schools, which are in your Highneſſes Realm, doth cauſe a want, and likewiſe an overthrow; both of them inconvenient, and one of them dangerous: for by means thereof they find want in the Country and Towns, both of Servants for Husbandry, and Apprentices for Trade; and on the other ſide, their being more Scholars bred than the State can prefer and imploy, and the active part of that life, not bearing a proportion to the preparative, it muſt needs fall out, that many perſons will be bred, unfit for other Vocations, and unprofitable for that in which they were bred up, which fills the Realm full of indigent, idle, and wanton people, which are but <hi>Materia reram novarum.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="104" facs="tcp:49566:78"/>Therefore, in this point, I wiſh Mr. <hi>Sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s intention were exalted a degree, that, that which he meant for Teachers of Children, your Majeſty ſhould make for Teachers of Men: wherein it hath been my ancient Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Obſervation, That in the Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this Realm (which I take to be the beſt endowed in <hi>Europe</hi>) there is nothing more wanting towards the flouriſhing ſtate of Learning, than the honourable and plentiful Salaries of Readers in Arts and Profeſſions; in which point, as your Majeſties Bounty al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready hath made a beginning, ſo this occaſion is offer'd of God to make a proceeding; ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Readers in the Chair, are as Parents in Sciences, and deſerve to enjoy a Condition not inferiour to their Children, who embrace the practical part, elſe no man will ſit longer in the Chair, than till he can walk to a better preferment: And it will come to paſs, as <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi> ſaith,
<q>Et Patrum invalidi referent jejunia Nati.</q>
For if the principal Readers, through the meanneſs of their entertainment, be but men of ſuperficial Learning, and that they ſhall take their places but in paſſage, it will make the Maſs of Sciences want the chief and ſolid dimenſion, which is depth, and to become but
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:49566:78"/>
pretty and compendious habits of Practice. Therefore I could wiſh that in both the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities, the Lectures, as well of the three Profeſſions, Divinity, Law, and Phyſick, as of the three Heads of Science, Philoſophy, Arts of Speech, and the Mathematicks, were raiſed to 100 <abbr>l.</abbr> 
                                 <hi>per Annum</hi> a piece; which though it be not near ſo great, as they are in ſome other places, where the greatneſs of the reward doth whiſtle for the ableſt men out of all Forreign parts to ſupply the Chair; yet it may be a Portion to content a worthy and able man, if he be likewiſe contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in nature, as thoſe Spirits are that are fitteſt for Lectures: Thus may Learning in your Kingdom be advanced to a further heighth; Learning (I ſay) which under your Majeſty, the moſt learned of Kings, may claim ſome degree of Elevation.</p>
                              <p>Concerning propagation of Religion, I ſhall in few words ſet before your Majeſty three Propoſitions; none of them devices of my own, otherwiſe than that I ever approved them: Two of which have been in agitation of ſpeech, and the third acted.</p>
                              <p>The firſt is a Colledge for Controverſies, whereby we ſhall not ſtill proceed ſingle, but ſhall, as it were, double our Files; which certainly will be found in the Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="106" facs="tcp:49566:79"/>The ſecond is a Receipt (I like not the word Seminary, in reſpect of the vain Vows, and implicite Obedience, and other things tending to the perturbation of States invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in that term) for Converts to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion, either of Youth, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: For I doubt not, but there are in <hi>Spain, Italy,</hi> and other Countries of the Papiſts, many whoſe hearts are touched with a ſenſe of thoſe corruptions, and an acknowledgment of a better way; which grace is many times ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered and choaked, through a worldly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of neceſſity and want; men not knowing where to have Succour and Refuge: This likewiſe I hold a work of great Piety, and of great Conſequence; that we alſo may be wiſe in our Generation, and that the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſilent night may be uſed as well for ſowing good Seed, as of Tares.</p>
                              <p>The third is, the Imitation of a Memorable and Religious Act of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who finding a part of <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> to be extremely backward in Religion; and the Benefices ſwallowed up in Impropriations, did by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree in the Dutchy, erect four Stipends of 100 <abbr>l.</abbr> 
                                 <hi>per Annum</hi> a piece for Preachers, well choſen to help the Harveſt, who have done a great deal of good in the parts they have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured: Neither do there want other Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the Realm, that would require
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:49566:79"/>
for a time the like extraordinary help.</p>
                              <p>Thus have I briefly delivered unto your Majeſty my Opinion touching the Employment of this Charity, whereby that Maſs of Wealth, which was in the Owner little better than a ſtack or heap of Muck, may be ſpread over your Kingdom, to many fruitful Purpoſes, your Majeſty planting and watering, and God giving the increaſe.</p>

                        <p>Thoſe, who ever underſtood the temper of this Learned Man, may eaſily perceive that at this time there were Baits enough laid for his partiality, that ſuch a mind as his, could not but be byaſs'd, nay, now he was to conteſt for oppoſition's ſake: This made him buſie and importunate, eager at the Barr, and earneſt in his Addreſſes to the King.</p>
                        <p>The Motives that incouraged him to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſe the Plaintiff's Quarrel, in ſhort were theſe.</p>

                        <p>I ſhall not undertake to anſwer the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Arguments in the Letter, but only briefly take thus much notice of it.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, The Simile of <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice</hi> amounts to no more than this; That we can do nothing perfectly, but yet we muſt do as well as we can, and in acts of Mercy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man is the proper Judge of his own Diſcretion.</p>

                        <p>What elſe is urged, is rather a large and ſtudied Eſſay of the end of Charity, than a thing proper to this Affair.</p>

                           <q>Here I cannot but take notice of a mighty Inconvenience which attends the School, and were it once remedied, it would certainly redound much to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the Lads, and the Honour of the Foundation: I humbly deſire that the Right Honourable the Governours, would take it into their conſideration; For how is it poſſible for ripe and well-grounded Lads to be ſent away to the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſities,

when Elections uſually come ſooner than the Scholars are prepared for them: And this truly ariſes from no other cauſe but this, when Boys are admitted into the Houſe, little or no regard is had to their Learning and Proficiency; but the thing mainly conſidered is, Whether they are between the years of Ten and Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen; and though they are ſcarce able to read, then they muſt be admitted.</q>

                        <p>The way to obtain a place for a young Lad or an old Gentleman, is much the ſame: <hi>viz.</hi> to make an addreſs to any ſingle Governour the Perſon has moſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in, by way of Friends, Petition, or any other method of Application: for no old Gentleman or Boy is choſen by a common Vote, but each Governour no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates in his turn: Then a Warrant is to be procured, if for a Lad, after this manner.</p>
